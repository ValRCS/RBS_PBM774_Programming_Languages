### Course Aims

* Learn the concept of a programming language: how humans
describe computations to be executed on a computer.

* Learn the tools for describing, defining, and implementing a
programming language: syntax and semantics

* Learn different program description paradigms
    * Imperative
    * Functional
    * Logic
    * Declarative
    * Object-oriented
    * Hybrid

### Course Grading

* 30% - Homework - 7 assignments 
* 10% - Weekly Quizzes + Participation
* 30% - Midterm - in class - around week 7
* 30% - Final - in class - around week 14
* Optional extra credit assignment - can raise the grade by 1 point

### Course Topics

* Introduction to Programming Languages
* Syntax and Semantics - BNF, EBNF, Syntax Diagrams
* Imperative Programming Languages Overview - **Go** 'A better C'
* Functional Programming Languages -> **Clojure** 'A better Lisp'
* Logic Programming Languages -> **Prolog**
* Declarative Programming Languages -> **SQL**
* Object-Oriented Programming Languages -> **Kotlin** 'A better Java'
* Hybrid Programming Languages -> **Rust** 'A better C++ or Scala'


### Course Materials

* Course Github Repository: https://github.com/ValRCS/RBS_PBM774_Programming_Languages

* Books - not absolutely necessary - but can be useful:

* https://www.cengage.uk/c/programming-logic-and-design-introductory-9e-farrell/9781337109635/ - official book for this course - however it is very general - lacks language specific details
* Concepts of Programming Languages, 12th edition by Robert W. Sebesta - used to be the main book for this course - still good if you have access to it
* Supplemental: https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/ - Programming Languages: Application and Interpretation by Shriram Krishnamurthi - free online book - very good for functional programming languages
