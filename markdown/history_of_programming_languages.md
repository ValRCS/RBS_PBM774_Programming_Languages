## Early pre-1950s history

The history of programming languages doesn't really begin in the 1950s but rather is predated by a set of computational ideas and inventions that laid the groundwork for modern computers and programming languages. Here are some significant milestones:

### Mechanical Devices and Tabulating Machines:

- **The Antikythera Mechanism (circa 150-100 BCE)**: An ancient Greek analog computer used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses.
- **Pascal's Calculator (1642)**: A mechanical device invented by Blaise Pascal for arithmetic calculations.
- **Leibniz's Stepped Reckoner (1694)**: Another early mechanical calculator, invented by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who also made significant contributions to binary number theory.
- **Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine (1837)**: This was a mechanical general-purpose computer design that featured an "arithmetic logic unit," control flow through "conditional branching and loops," and memory—concepts that are central to modern computers.
- **Herman Hollerith's Tabulating Machine (1890)**: Developed to tabulate the U.S. Census, it was the foundation for the company that would become IBM. It used punched cards to store data and perform simple calculations.

### Conceptual Foundations:

- **George Boole's "An Investigation of the Laws of Thought" (1854)**: This work laid the foundations for Boolean algebra, which would later form the basis for digital circuit design theory and programming.
- **Ada Lovelace's Notes (1843)**: While she was translating an article about Babbage's Analytical Engine, Lovelace wrote extensive notes and annotations, including what is often cited as the first "program"—a sequence of operations for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. This has led to her being credited as the world's first computer programmer, although the machine was never built to test her program.
- **Alan Turing's Computability Theory (1936)**: Turing's concept of a "universal machine" laid the foundation for the theory of computation and the modern computer.
- **Claude Shannon's Work (1937)**: He applied Boolean algebra to digital circuit design theory, providing the foundation for digital circuit design, in a master's thesis at MIT. This work was foundational in the development of digital computers.
- **Konrad Zuse's Z3 (1941)**: The world's first electromechanical programmable computer, which used a binary number system and boolean algebra.

### Early Electronic Computers:

- **ENIAC (1945)**: The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was one of the earliest electronic general-purpose computers. Programming ENIAC was a laborious process, involving setting a myriad of switches and dials.
- **Von Neumann Architecture (1945)**: John von Neumann's architecture concept separated the computer into a 'control unit' and 'arithmetic logic unit,' a 'memory,' and 'input/output devices.' This forms the basis for almost all modern computers.
- **Assembly Language and Short Code (late 1940s)**: The first symbolic programming languages, they were precursors to modern high-level languages and allowed programmers to work with symbolic representations of machine code.

These earlier advances set the stage for the high-level programming languages that started to emerge in the 1950s.



------------------
## 1950s

The emergence of high-level programming languages in the 1950s was a major milestone in the history of computing. Before this period, programming was largely done in machine code or assembly languages, which were tightly linked to specific hardware and required an intimate understanding of the machine's architecture. High-level languages abstracted away many of these hardware-specific details, enabling programmers to focus more on problem-solving and less on machine-specific commands. Here's a deeper look at how this came about:

### The Need for Abstraction

- **Complexity**: As computers grew more complex and versatile, there was a growing need for a more accessible way to program them.
- **Portability**: Machine-level programming was hardware-specific, making it difficult to move software between different types of computers.
- **Productivity**: Writing and debugging programs in machine code or assembly was extremely time-consuming.

### Early Attempts

- **Short Code (also known as Simple Code)**: Developed for IBM's 701 computer in the early 1950s, Short Code was not a programming language in the modern sense, but it was one of the earliest attempts to provide a higher level of abstraction for programming.

### FORTRAN (1957)

- **Design Goals**: FORTRAN (Formula Translation) was designed to allow scientists and engineers to express their mathematical formulas in a way that could be easily translated into machine code.
- **Compiler**: One of FORTRAN's groundbreaking contributions was its compiler, which translated high-level source code into machine code. This was a dramatic improvement in terms of both ease of use and program efficiency.
- **Legacy**: FORTRAN's success paved the way for the acceptance of high-level languages. It is still in use today, particularly for scientific and engineering applications.

### LISP (1958)

- **AI and Symbolic Computing**: LISP (List Processing) was developed by John McCarthy for research in artificial intelligence. It introduced concepts such as recursion and symbolic computation.
- **Features**: LISP was among the first languages to feature garbage collection and dynamic typing, and it popularized the concept of treating code as data and data as code (the "code is data" paradigm).
- **Legacy**: LISP influenced many later languages and is still in use for certain specialized tasks, especially in AI research.

### COBOL (1959)

- **Business Use**: COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) was developed by a committee of experts from industry and government. It was intended for business, finance, and administrative systems for companies and governments.
- **Readable Syntax**: COBOL was designed to be readable, using English-like syntax to make the code understandable even to non-programmers.
- **Legacy**: COBOL programs are still running many business and government systems, particularly in financial sectors.

### ALGOL (1958-1960)

- **Algorithmic Language**: ALGOL (Algorithmic Language) was developed by an international committee and aimed to provide a portable language for algorithms.
- **Block Structure**: Introduced the concept of block structure, which became a staple in many future languages.
- **Influence**: ALGOL was never widely adopted for practical computing but was immensely influential in both education and language design, laying groundwork for languages like Pascal, C, and C++.

### Early Conferences and Standardization

- As these languages gained popularity, the first programming language conferences began to be held, and the idea of language standardization emerged.

These early high-level languages of the 1950s set the stage for the future development of programming languages and are the ancestors of the languages in use today. They abstracted away many of the complexities associated with machine-level programming and provided a more user-friendly, portable, and productive means for developing software.



------------------

- **Formal Verification**: There's a growing interest in languages and tools that support formal verification, ensuring that code behaves as expected under all conditions.

### Machine Learning and Data Science

- **Domain-Specific Languages**: As machine learning algorithms become increasingly sophisticated, new domain-specific languages (DSLs) for describing these algorithms could emerge.
- **Automated Code Generation**: Machine learning models may assist in code generation, or even in debugging and optimization tasks.

### Concurrent, Parallel, and Distributed Systems

- **Native Support for Concurrency**: As hardware becomes increasingly parallel (multi-core, distributed systems, etc.), future programming languages will likely natively support concurrent and parallel execution.
- **Data Distribution and Replication**: Languages may provide abstractions for efficient data distribution and replication in cloud and distributed environments.

### Interoperability

- **Multi-Platform Languages**: The ability to write code once and run it on multiple platforms without modification is already valuable and will continue to be so.
- **Polyglot Programming**: Tools and languages that facilitate seamless integration with other languages may become increasingly important.

### Energy-Efficient Programming

- **Optimization for Energy Consumption**: As energy efficiency becomes more crucial, languages that enable energy-efficient programming or that optimize code for energy efficiency might gain traction.

### Web Development

- **Beyond JavaScript**: WebAssembly might pave the way for languages other than JavaScript to play a significant role in web development.
- **Serverless Architectures**: Languages optimized for serverless computing could emerge, given the growing popularity of this architecture.

### Developer Experience

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Languages that facilitate quick prototyping without sacrificing performance could become more popular.
- **Improved Tooling**: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) will likely become more intelligent and assistive, further improving developer productivity.

### Specialized Hardware

- **Quantum Computing**: As quantum computing moves closer to practical usability, quantum programming languages may become more prevalent.
- **IoT Devices**: Languages optimized for the constrained environments of IoT devices could gain in importance.

### Ethical and Social Considerations

- **Ethical Programming**: As ethics in technology becomes a growing concern, we might see the emergence of languages or frameworks specifically designed to enforce ethical considerations, such as privacy and security.

### Open Source and Community-Driven

- **Community Input**: Open-source languages that are backed by strong communities are likely to be more resilient and adaptive to changing needs.

It's worth noting that these trends are not mutually exclusive and could converge in interesting ways, giving rise to languages and tools that are versatile, efficient, and focused on enabling high-quality software engineering.
