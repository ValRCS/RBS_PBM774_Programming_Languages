    "## Prolog overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Paradigm**: Prolog is primarily a logic programming language. Instead of writing a sequential series of steps to solve a problem, as you would in imperative languages, in Prolog you define a set of facts and rules, and then query the system to deduce new facts.\n",
    "- **Facts and Rules**:\n",
    "   - **Facts** are basic assertions about some situation. For example: `likes(john, pizza).` asserts that John likes pizza.\n",
    "   - **Rules** allow you to infer new facts from existing ones. For instance:\n",
    "   ```prolog\n",
    "   friend(X, Y) :- likes(X, Z), likes(Y, Z).\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "This rule states that X is a friend of Y if both X and Y like Z.\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: One of Prolog's most distinctive features. If Prolog cannot directly find a solution to a query, it will backtrack and try alternative paths until it either finds a solution or exhausts all possibilities. This makes Prolog particularly suited for tasks like searching and pattern matching.\n",
    "- **Queries**: After defining facts and rules, you can ask the Prolog system questions or queries. For example, with the facts and rules above, you can query: `?- likes(john, What).` and Prolog might respond with `What = pizza.`\n",
    "- **Variables**: In Prolog, variables start with a capital letter or an underscore and can stand for any value. In the query example above, `What` is a variable.\n",
    "- **Unification**: It is the process of making two terms equal by finding an appropriate substitution. For instance, if you have a fact `likes(john, apple)` and a query `likes(john, What)`, unification will bind the variable `What` to `apple`.\n",
    "- **Cuts**: The cut (`!`) in Prolog is a way to limit backtracking. When Prolog encounters a cut, it commits to the choices made so far in the current rule. This can be used to improve efficiency but must be used with caution as it can alter the semantics of the program.\n",
    "- **Applications**: Prolog is often associated with artificial intelligence, particularly expert systems and natural language processing, though it can be used in many other domains as well.\n",
    "- **Implementations**: There are several Prolog implementations available. SWI-Prolog and GNU Prolog are among the most popular.\n",
    "- **Limitations**: While Prolog's declarative nature can simplify many tasks, it might not be the best fit for all problems, especially those that are inherently sequential or require low-level control. Additionally, logic programming has a learning curve for those accustomed to more traditional programming paradigms."

    "## History of Prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "Prolog has an interesting history, deeply intertwined with the evolution of artificial intelligence and formal logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Roots in Formal Logic**: Prolog's foundations lie in formal logic, particularly first-order predicate logic. The idea was to represent knowledge and reason with it using automated theorem provers.\n",
    "- **Birth of Prolog**:\n",
    "   - The inception of Prolog dates back to the 1970s. It was developed by Alain Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel, at the University of Aix-Marseille in France. Colmerauer wanted to create a language for natural language processing.\n",
    "   - The name \"Prolog\" stands for \"PROgrammation en LOGique\" (Programming in Logic).\n",
    "- **Early Applications**:\n",
    "   - Prolog's early days saw its use in AI research and in natural language processing projects. Its capability for pattern matching and symbolic computation made it a natural choice for such tasks.\n",
    "- **Spread and Popularity**:\n",
    "   - David H. D. Warren, at the University of Edinburgh, developed the DEC-10 Prolog, which was one of the first efficient and influential Prolog systems.\n",
    "   - During the 1980s, Prolog saw a surge in popularity, particularly in Europe, and became associated with the promising field of expert systems. This led to commercial investment and the development of several Prolog implementations.\n",
    "- **The Fifth Generation Computer Systems Project**:\n",
    "   - In the 1980s, Japan initiated the Fifth Generation Computer Systems project (FGCS). It aimed to create a new kind of computer based on the parallel processing of massive numbers of simple computations. Prolog was chosen as the primary language for this project.\n",
    "   - While the project did not meet all its ambitious goals, it did advance the field of logic programming and parallel computing.\n",
    "- **ISO Standardization**:\n",
    "   - Efforts began in the late 1980s to standardize Prolog, given its various implementations.\n",
    "   - In 1995, the ISO standard for Prolog was established, providing a consistent specification that implementations could adhere to.\n",
    "- **Modern Day Prolog**:\n",
    "   - While Prolog might not be as mainstream as languages like Python or Java, it remains a key language in the domain of symbolic computing, AI, and certain niche areas.\n",
    "   - Modern implementations like SWI-Prolog have extended the language's capabilities, offering integration with other languages, web frameworks, and more.\n",
    "- **Notable Figures**:\n",
    "   - Apart from Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel, Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh also played a pivotal role in the theoretical foundation of Prolog. He articulated the principle that \"algorithm equals logic plus control,\" bridging the gap between logic and computation."

    "Cloud computing has opened avenues for many programming languages, including Prolog, to be executed in cloud environments. Here are some cloud-based options for running Prolog:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SWI-PROLOG notebook**: SWI-Prolog provides a web-based notebook interface for running Prolog code. It's a great way to get started with Prolog without any setup.\n",
    "**https://swish.swi-prolog.org/**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebooks based Prolog**: You can run Prolog in a Jupyter Notebook using the `pyswip` library. This allows you to combine Prolog code with other languages like Python in a single notebook.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Virtual Machines (Infrastructure as a Service - IaaS)**:\n",
    "   - **Amazon EC2**: You can set up an EC2 instance on AWS and install Prolog on a Linux, Windows, or any other supported OS.\n",
    "   - **Google Compute Engine**: Similar to EC2, you can run a VM and set up Prolog.\n",
    "   - **Microsoft Azure VM**: Azure's virtual machine service can also be used to run Prolog.\n",
    "For these VM-based approaches, once the VM is set up, you would install Prolog as you would on a local machine.\n",
    "- **Containers (Platform as a Service - PaaS & Container Solutions)**:\n",
    "   - **Docker**: You can find Prolog Docker images, like SWI-Prolog, on DockerHub. Once you have a Docker image, you can run it in any cloud provider that supports Docker (AWS ECS, Google Kubernetes Engine, Azure Kubernetes Service, etc.).\n",
    "   - **Heroku**: While Heroku primarily supports web applications, you can set up a custom buildpack or use Docker to run Prolog.\n",
    "- **Cloud-based IDEs & REPLs**:\n",
    "   - **REPL.it**: An online IDE that supports many languages, including Prolog. It allows you to write, run, and share Prolog code snippets without any setup.\n",
    "   - **Gitpod**: While primarily used for development with mainstream languages, you can configure a custom environment to run Prolog.\n",
    "- **Serverless (Function as a Service - FaaS)**:\n",
    "   - You could theoretically wrap Prolog in a lightweight API using a language/runtime supported by serverless platforms (like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions). When the API is called, it could execute Prolog queries. However, this is more complex and might be overkill for simple needs.\n",
    "- **Specialized Cloud Services for Logic & AI**:\n",
    "   - While there are no major cloud services specifically for Prolog, several AI services in major cloud providers can potentially integrate with Prolog applications to leverage its logical reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "When opting for a cloud solution, remember to consider factors like cost, scalability needs, and ease of use. For simple Prolog projects or learning purposes, online IDEs like REPL.it might be the easiest, while for production-grade applications, VMs or container solutions might be more appropriate.\n",

    "Prolog programs are made up of facts and rules. Facts are basic assertions about some situation, while rules allow you to infer new facts from existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming in Prolog can be quite different from programming in more conventional languages. Let's explore some of its fundamental tenets:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Declarative Paradigm**:\n",
    "   - Prolog is a declarative programming language, which means you define what you want to achieve, not how you want to achieve it. The \"how\" is determined by Prolog's built-in mechanism.\n",
    "- **Facts, Rules, and Queries**:\n",
    "   - **Facts**: They are basic assertions that indicate a certain condition or relationship is true. For example:\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "   likes(alice, chocolate).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Rules**: They define relationships between facts and can be used to infer new facts. Rules consist of a head and a body. If the body is true, then the head is also true. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "   loves(X, Y) :- likes(X, Y), trusts(X, Y).\n",
    "```\n",
    "This can be read as \"X loves Y if X likes Y and X trusts Y.\"\n",
    "   - **Queries**: They are questions you ask about the stored facts and rules. Queries are how you interact with a Prolog system.\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "   ?- likes(alice, What).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Unification**:\n",
    "   - One of the core concepts in Prolog. It's the process by which Prolog matches terms. For example, the query `?- likes(alice, chocolate).` can unify with the fact `likes(alice, chocolate).`\n",
    "   - Variables, starting with an uppercase letter or an underscore, can unify with any term. In the process, they get instantiated with the corresponding term value.\n",
    "- **Backtracking**:\n",
    "   - If Prolog cannot find a solution immediately, it tries alternative solutions by going back to the previous choices and attempting different paths. This is called backtracking.\n",
    "- **Recursion**:\n",
    "   - Due to the absence of traditional loop constructs, iteration in Prolog is achieved through recursion. Recursive rules are common in Prolog to iterate over data structures like lists.\n",
    "- **Lists**:\n",
    "   - Lists are a fundamental data structure in Prolog. For example, `[apple, banana, cherry]` is a list of three fruits.\n",
    "   - The `|` operator can be used to separate the head of a list from its tail, like `[Head|Tail]`.\n",
    "- **Cut (`!`)**:\n",
    "   - The cut is a control structure that limits backtracking. When Prolog encounters a cut, it commits to the current choice and won't backtrack past the cut.\n",
    "- **Built-in Predicates**:\n",
    "   - Prolog has many built-in predicates for tasks like arithmetic, list manipulation, and I/O operations. For instance, `is/2` is used for arithmetic evaluations, and `write/1` is used to print to the console.\n",
    "- **Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs)**:\n",
    "   - Prolog offers DCGs, a powerful feature to handle and parse natural language constructs and sequences.\n",
    "- **Modules**:\n",
    "   - Prolog supports modular programming, allowing code to be split into reusable modules.\n",
    "- **Constraint Logic Programming (CLP)**:\n",
    "   - Extensions of Prolog, such as CLP(FD), allow users to solve problems by stating constraints on variables. This is particularly useful for problems like scheduling and puzzle-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming in Prolog often involves a different mindset than more traditional imperative or object-oriented programming. It's about describing relationships and letting the Prolog engine deduce answers based on those relationships. This makes it particularly powerful for tasks like pattern matching, symbolic computation, and knowledge representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Most important: - **\"order of writing facts & rules always matters\"**. Prolog performs depth-first search, so it will try to match the first rule first, then the second, and so on. "

    "## Simple Use cases for Prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "Prolog is well-suited for problems that involve symbolic reasoning, pattern matching, and knowledge representation. Here are a few simple problems that highlight Prolog's strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Puzzle Solving**: The classic example here is the \"Einstein's Riddle\" or \"Zebra Puzzle\". The problem involves deducing the correct associations between multiple properties (e.g., nationality, house color, pet) based on a set of clues. Prolog's logical reasoning capabilities make it ideal for solving this kind of problem.\n",
    "- **Path Finding**: Given a graph (defined by facts that specify nodes and edges), you can use Prolog to determine if there's a path between two nodes or even find the shortest path. This can be done using recursive rules and backtracking.\n",
    "- **Ancestor Tree**: Extend the family tree example to find not just direct ancestors (parents, grandparents) but also nth generation ancestors.\n",
    "- **Towers of Hanoi**: A classic recursive problem that can be elegantly solved in Prolog.\n",
    "- **Sudoku Solver**: Define a Sudoku board as a set of facts and use rules to determine the values of the unknown cells based on constraints. Prolog's backtracking mechanism is particularly useful here.\n",
    "- **Database Queries**: Create a mock database using Prolog facts (e.g., books, authors, and publishers) and then write queries to retrieve specific data, like all books by a certain author.\n",
    "- **Natural Language Parsing**: Using definite clause grammars (DCGs) in Prolog, you can parse sentences, check their grammatical correctness, or even convert them into another representation (like a semantic tree).\n",
    "- **Eight Queens Puzzle**: Place eight chess queens on an 8x8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This involves ensuring that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal, and Prolog can be used to find all such valid arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of problem largely depends on what you wish to showcase. If you want to emphasize pattern matching and logical reasoning, puzzles or games are a good choice. For symbolic processing or grammar-related tasks, natural language problems are ideal. Remember, the power of Prolog lies in its ability to express complex relationships and constraints declaratively and then let the Prolog engine do the work to find solutions."

    "## Variables in Prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "In Prolog, variables are not \"defined\" in the same way as in many other programming languages. Instead, variables in Prolog are placeholders that can be bound to specific values during the evaluation of a query. Here's what you need to know about variables in Prolog:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Naming**: Variables in Prolog start with an uppercase letter or an underscore (`_`). Examples include `X`, `HouseColor`, or `_temporaryVar`. If it starts with a lowercase letter, it's considered an atom, not a variable.\n",
    "- **Instantiation**: Variables become instantiated (bound to a specific value) during the process of unification. Once a variable is bound to a value, it remains bound to that value within its context (rule or query evaluation). For instance, in the query `father(X, john)`, if there's a fact `father(paul, john)`, the variable `X` becomes instantiated to the atom `paul`.\n",
    "- **Anonymous Variables**: An underscore (`_`) is a special variable known as an anonymous variable. It is used when we don't care about the value it gets bound to. Each appearance of the underscore is treated as a distinct variable, meaning they can be bound to different values without affecting each other.\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: Prolog's backtracking mechanism can revert (or \"unbind\") variables. If one solution doesn't work out, Prolog will backtrack, unbind the variable, and try a different binding to find a solution.\n",
    "- **Variable Scope**: Variables in Prolog are scoped to the clause in which they appear. Two clauses don't share variable bindings unless they are part of the same rule or query.\n",
    "- **Var Predicate**: You can use the built-in predicate `var/1` to check if a term is a currently uninstantiated variable. Similarly, the predicate `nonvar/1` can be used to check if a term is not an uninstantiated variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog<button class=\"flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center\"><svg stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"icon-sm\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2\"></path><rect x=\"8\" y=\"2\" width=\"8\" height=\"4\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>\n",

    "## Atoms in Prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "In Prolog, atoms are a fundamental data type that represents symbolic constants. They are similar to identifiers or enumerated types in other languages. Here are the key characteristics of atoms:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Representation**: Atoms can consist of a series of letters, numbers, and some special characters. They can start with a lowercase letter. For example: `apple`, `red_color`, `x3y4`, and `hello_world` are all atoms.\n",
    "- **Case Sensitivity**: Atoms are case sensitive. Therefore, `apple` and `Apple` are considered two different atoms.\n",
    "- **Special Characters**: Atoms can also be composed entirely of special characters, e.g., `++`, `-->`, `:-`, and `==`.\n",
    "- **Quoted Atoms**: If you want an atom to contain spaces, uppercase letters at the start, or special characters that don't form a standard symbolic atom, you can enclose it in single quotes. For instance: `'Hello World'`, `'X marks the spot'`, and `'123'` are all atoms.\n",
    "- **Comparison**: Atoms can be compared using standard comparison predicates like `=`, `\\=`, `==`, and `\\==`. Their order, when using predicates like `<` or `>`, is based on the internal ordering in Prolog, which might not be intuitive. If a specific ordering is required, it should be defined explicitly.\n",
    "- **Conversion**: Atoms can be converted to other data types and vice versa using built-in predicates. For example, `atom_codes/2` can be used to convert an atom to a list of its character codes.\n",
    "- **Distinction from Variables**: Atoms start with a lowercase letter, while variables start with an uppercase letter or an underscore. This is a crucial distinction in Prolog. For instance, `apple` is an atom, whereas `Apple` or `_apple` are variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, atoms in Prolog are a way to represent named constants, much like strings without the operations associated with character manipulation (though you can convert between atoms and strings/lists of character codes if needed). They're frequently used to denote specific, known values in facts and rules."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "In Prolog, facts are the most basic and fundamental means of representing knowledge. They state something that the system knows to be true. A fact in Prolog is a statement that represents a relation between objects or, in some cases, an attribute of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of facts in Prolog:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Structure**: Facts consist of a predicate and its arguments. The number of arguments a predicate takes is called its arity. The combination of the predicate's name and its arity is sometimes used to uniquely identify it, using the format `predicate/arity`.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "   - `father(john, mike).` - This fact states that John is Mike's father.\n",
    "   - `blue(sky).` - This fact states that the sky is blue.\n",
    "- **Termination**: Every fact in Prolog ends with a period (`.`).\n",
    "- **Database**: All the facts that you provide to Prolog (usually in a source file) form its knowledge base (or database). When you query Prolog, it searches its database to find matching facts (or derives answers using rules, which are more complex than facts).\n",
    "- **Arity**: Facts can have any number of arguments. For instance:\n",
    "   - `sibling(john, mike).` - Arity is 2.\n",
    "   - `coordinates(point1, 5, 7).` - Arity is 3.\n",
    "- **No Return Value**: Unlike functions in procedural programming languages, facts in Prolog don't have a return value. Instead, they state a particular relationship or attribute that is true.\n",
    "- **Querying**: You can query a fact to check its truthfulness. For example, if the fact `father(john, mike).` is in the database, the query `?- father(john, mike).` would return `true`.\n",
    "- **Ground Facts**: Facts in Prolog are typically ground, meaning they don't contain variables. They represent specific, known information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, facts in Prolog are foundational pieces of information that the system uses to answer queries. When combined with rules (which allow for inferencing), they provide a robust way for the system to reason about the knowledge it has."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Rules in Prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "In Prolog, while facts state static pieces of information, rules provide a means to infer new information from the existing knowledge base. Rules represent implications or logical relationships between terms. They allow Prolog to reason and deduce conclusions from given facts and other rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of rules in Prolog:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Structure**: A rule has a head and a body, separated by `:-` (read as \"if\"). The head contains a predicate that becomes true if everything in the body (the conditions) is true. The entire rule concludes with a period (`.`).\n",
    "- **Example**: Consider the following rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "grandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This rule states that \"X is a grandparent of Y if X is a parent of Z and Z is a parent of Y.\" Here, `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are variables that can be instantiated to specific individuals when querying the rule.\n",
    "- **Variables**: Variables in rules are placeholders that get bound to specific values during the query process. They start with an uppercase letter or an underscore. In the above rule, `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are variables.\n",
    "- **Conjunction**: Rules can have multiple conditions in the body, separated by commas. This is a logical conjunction (AND operation). All the conditions must be true for the rule's head to be considered true.\n",
    "- **Recursion**: Rules can be recursive, allowing Prolog to perform iterative operations. For example, a rule to determine the ancestry relation might refer to itself to traverse a family tree.\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: Prolog uses backtracking to explore different ways a rule can be satisfied, especially if there are multiple facts that might fit a condition in a rule.\n",
    "- **Database Interaction**: Rules work in conjunction with the database of facts (and other rules). When a rule's conditions are being checked, Prolog searches its knowledge base to find matching facts or to apply other rules that might lead to the satisfaction of the conditions.\n",
    "- **Disjunction**: While the comma `,` allows for conjunctions, you can also represent disjunctions (OR operations) in rules. One way to do this is by defining multiple rules with the same head. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "likes(X, Y) :- good_friend(X, Y).\n",
    "likes(X, Y) :- family(X, Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This states that \"X likes Y if X and Y are good friends or if they are family.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, rules in Prolog allow the representation of logic and relationships. Combined with facts, they provide a powerful mechanism for symbolic reasoning, enabling Prolog to deduce new information from the given knowledge."

    "## Queries in Prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "In Prolog, a query is a way to ask the system a question based on the facts and rules stored in its knowledge base. When you pose a query to Prolog, the system attempts to find a solution by matching the query against the facts and rules, using a process called pattern matching. If a match is found, the query succeeds, and Prolog provides an answer. If no match is found, the query fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you need to know about queries in Prolog:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Formulation**: Queries are posed at the Prolog prompt, usually represented as `?-`. After formulating the query, you end it with a period (`.`).\n",
    "- **Variables**: Queries can contain variables, which allow you to ask open-ended questions. When a query with variables succeeds, Prolog binds these variables to specific values that make the query true. For example, with the fact `father(john, mike).` in the knowledge base, if you query `?- father(john, X).`, Prolog will respond with `X = mike`.\n",
    "- **Multiple Solutions**: Some queries have multiple valid solutions. Prolog will present one solution at a time. By pressing a specific key (usually `;`), you can ask Prolog to search for more solutions. The search continues until all solutions are found or until the user decides not to continue.\n",
    "- **Conjunctions and Disjunctions**: You can combine multiple conditions in a query using `,` for logical AND and `;` for logical OR. For example, the query `?- father(X, mike), mother(Y, mike).` will search for both Mike's father and mother.\n",
    "- **Negation**: You can use the `\\+` predicate to represent negation in queries. For instance, `?- \\+ father(john, anna).` asks if it's NOT true that John is Anna's father.\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: Prolog uses backtracking to find multiple solutions to a query. If the current solution doesn't satisfy all conditions, Prolog will backtrack, undo previous decisions, and try alternative paths.\n",
    "- **Built-in Predicates**: Prolog provides various built-in predicates that can be used in queries. For example, `member/2`, `is/2`, and `write/1` are built-in predicates that can be used to check if an element is a member of a list, perform arithmetic, or print results, respectively.\n",
    "- **Failures**: If Prolog cannot find any solution to a query, it responds with `false.` indicating that the query failed (or no solution exists given the current knowledge base).\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, queries in Prolog are the means to interact with the system, ask questions, and retrieve information based on the provided facts and rules. The power of Prolog comes from its ability to reason about these facts and rules to find answers, even if the answers aren't explicitly stored in the database.\n"

    "## Data types and Data Structures in Prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "Prolog offers a unique set of data types and data structures tailored for symbolic reasoning and logic programming. Here's an overview of the primary data types and structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Atoms**: Atoms are symbolic names and are typically used to represent constants in Prolog. They start with a lowercase letter (unless quoted) and can contain letters, digits, underscore, or any other symbol. Examples include `apple`, `john_doe`, `'123'`, and `'Hello World'`.\n",
    "- **Numbers**: Prolog supports both integers and floating-point numbers.\n",
    "   - **Integers**: Such as `123`, `-456`, `0`.\n",
    "   - **Floats**: Such as `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0E3`.\n",
    "- **Variables**: Variables are placeholders for any Prolog term. They start with an uppercase letter or an underscore (`_`). For example, `X`, `Y`, `_TempVar`.\n",
    "- **Compound Terms**: These are used to represent structured data and are composed of a functor (name) and a number of arguments (arity).\n",
    "   - Example: `father_of(john, mike)` where `father_of/2` is the functor and `john, mike` are the arguments.\n",
    "- **Lists**: Lists are a fundamental data structure in Prolog and are used to represent collections of items. They are similar to linked lists in other programming languages.\n",
    "   - Example: `[a, b, c]`\n",
    "   - Head and Tail: Lists can be split into their head (first element) and tail (remaining elements) using the `|` notation. Example: `[H | T]` when matched with `[a, b, c]` will bind `H` to `a` and `T` to `[b, c]`.\n",
    "   - Empty List: `[]`\n",
    "- **Strings**: In some modern Prolog implementations, especially SWI-Prolog, strings are sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes, like `\"Hello World\"`. However, traditionally, Prolog didn't have a distinct string type, and strings were often represented as lists of ASCII codes or as atoms.\n",
    "- **Associative Arrays (Dictionaries)**: Some modern Prolog systems, like SWI-Prolog, have introduced dictionaries, which are similar to associative arrays in other languages. They allow you to associate keys with values.\n",
    "   - Example: `dict(color=red, size=large)`\n",
    "- **Operators**: Prolog has a set of predefined operators (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `is`, `=:=`, `=<`, etc.), and you can define new ones. They allow for more readable expressions and rules.\n",
    "- **Other Special Constants**:\n",
    "   - **`!` (Cut)**: Used to control the backtracking mechanism.\n",
    "   - **`fail` and `true`**: Represent failure and success, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to note that, given its declarative nature, Prolog's data types and structures are designed with pattern matching, recursion, and symbolic reasoning in mind. Lists, in particular, are central to many Prolog algorithms, and the language's built-in mechanisms for handling them (like unifying with `[Head | Tail]`) make many operations naturally expressive."
