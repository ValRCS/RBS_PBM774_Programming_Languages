    "## User Input\n",
    "\n",
    "User input from the command line in Clojure is commonly handled using the `read-line` function for textual input, and the `*command-line-args*` variable for command line arguments. Here's a quick breakdown of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Textual Input with `read-line`\n",
    "The `read-line` function reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string. The function blocks until Enter (newline) is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defn ask-name []\n",
    "  (println \"What is your name?\")\n",
    "  (let [name (read-line)]\n",
    "    (println \"Hello,\" name)))\n",
    "\n",
    "(ask-name)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, when you run the function `ask-name`, it will print \"What is your name?\", then wait for you to type something. Whatever you type becomes the value of the `name` variable, and \"Hello, [Your Name]\" will be printed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Command Line Arguments with `*command-line-args*`\n",
    "Clojure provides the `*command-line-args*` dynamic variable, which contains any command line arguments passed to the script. This is particularly useful for scripts and standalone applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that reads command line arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defn main []\n",
    "  (println \"Command line arguments:\" *command-line-args*))\n",
    "\n",
    ";; Set the -main function for the application.\n",
    "(set! *main-cli-fn* main)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you run this script from the command line with arguments, it prints them out:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ clojure my_script.clj arg1 arg2 arg3\n",
    "Command line arguments: (arg1 arg2 arg3)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Combined Example\n",
    "You can combine both techniques in the same application to read command-line arguments and prompt the user for input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defn main []\n",
    "  (println \"Command line arguments:\" *command-line-args*)\n",
    "  (println \"What is your name?\")\n",
    "  (let [name (read-line)]\n",
    "    (println \"Hello,\" name)))\n",
    "\n",
    "(set! *main-cli-fn* main)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This program first prints out any command line arguments it receives, then asks the user for their name and greets them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries for Advanced Parsing\n",
    "For more advanced command-line parsing, you may want to use libraries like `clojure.tools.cli` that provide more functionality for defining and parsing command line options."

    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In Clojure, lists are one of the fundamental data structures and are deeply integrated into the language's design. They are ordered collections that are similar to linked lists in other languages. Here is a thorough overview of what you can do with lists in Clojure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Lists\n",
    "You can create lists in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the list literal, which is simply a series of elements enclosed in parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(def my-list '(1 2 3))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Using the `list` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(def my-list (list 1 2 3))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First**: Get the first element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(first '(1 2 3))  ; => 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Rest**: Get all elements except the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(rest '(1 2 3))  ; => (2 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Last**: Get the last element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(last '(1 2 3))  ; => 3\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Butlast**: Get all elements except the last one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(butlast '(1 2 3))  ; => (1 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Conj**: Add an element to the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(conj '(2 3) 1)  ; => (1 2 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Count**: Count the number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(count '(1 2 3))  ; => 3\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### List Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map**: Apply a function to each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(map inc '(1 2 3))  ; => (2 3 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Filter**: Keep elements that satisfy a predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(filter even? '(1 2 3 4))  ; => (2 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Reduce**: Reduce elements to a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(reduce + '(1 2 3))  ; => 6\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Reverse**: Reverse the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(reverse '(1 2 3))  ; => (3 2 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concat**: Concatenate multiple lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(concat '(1 2) '(3 4))  ; => (1 2 3 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Append**: You can use `into` to append elements of one list to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(into '(1 2) '(3 4))  ; => (1 2 3 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Lists and Flattening\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flatten**: Flatten a nested list.```clojure\n",
    "(flatten '(1 (2 (3 4) 5)))  ; => (1 2 3 4 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicate Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Empty**: Check if a list is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(empty? '())  ; => true\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Contains**: Since lists are sequences, you can use `some` to check for the presence of an element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(some #(= % 2) '(1 2 3))  ; => true\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Partition**: Divide the list into sub-lists of a given size.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(partition 2 '(1 2 3 4))  ; => ((1 2) (3 4))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Take, Drop**: Get or remove the first `n` elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(take 2 '(1 2 3 4))  ; => (1 2)\n",
    "(drop 2 '(1 2 3 4))  ; => (3 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Destructuring\n",
    "Clojure supports destructuring, which can be very handy when working with lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(let [[first-elm second-elm] '(1 2 3)]\n",
    "  (println first-elm second-elm))  ; Output: 1 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Converting To/From Other Data Structures\n",
    "You can convert lists to and from other data structures like vectors, sets, and maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(vec '(1 2 3))  ; => [1 2 3]\n",
    "(set '(1 2 3))  ; => #{1 2 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Laziness\n",
    "Many sequence operations in Clojure are lazy, which means they are not computed until needed. This allows you to operate on large or even infinite lists efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(take 5 (cycle '(1 2 3)))  ; => (1 2 3 1 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is by no means an exhaustive list, but these are some of the most commonly used operations and techniques for working with lists in Clojure."
