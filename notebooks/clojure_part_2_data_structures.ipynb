    "## Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespaces are a way to group related functions and data together. They are also a way to avoid name collisions. Namespaces are declared with the `ns` macro.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespaces in Clojure are used to group related functions, variables, and other identifiers together. Namespaces are similar to packages in languages like Java or modules in Python. They help to avoid name clashes and make it easier to organize and manage code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common aspects of working with namespaces in Clojure:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring a Namespace\n",
    "You declare a namespace at the top of a Clojure file with the `ns` macro. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(ns my-app.core)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This declares a namespace named `my-app.core`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Functions from Other Namespaces\n",
    "To use functions from other namespaces, you have several options:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Require in `ns` declaration**: The most common way is to include them in the `ns` declaration using `:require`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(ns my-app.core\n",
    "  (:require [clojure.string :as str]))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you can use functions from `clojure.string` by prefixing them with the alias `str`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(str/upper-case \"hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Require within code**: You can also use `require` within your code, although this is less common and generally not recommended for production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(require '[clojure.string :as str])\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Use fully qualified names**: You can use the fully qualified name of a function without requiring the namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(clojure.string/upper-case \"hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Functions and Variables\n",
    "Within a namespace, you can define functions and variables as you normally would.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(ns my-app.core)\n",
    "\n",
    "(defn my-function [x]\n",
    "  (* x x))\n",
    "\n",
    "(def my-variable 42)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Refer and Use\n",
    "You can also selectively import specific functions from another namespace using `:refer` or import all functions using `:use`, although `:use` is generally not recommended because it makes it harder to identify where a function comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(ns my-app.core\n",
    "  (:require [clojure.string :refer [upper-case]]))\n",
    "\n",
    ";; Now you can use upper-case directly\n",
    "(upper-case \"hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Create and Switch Namespaces in REPL\n",
    "In the REPL, you can create and switch namespaces using the `in-ns` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(in-ns 'new-namespace)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Namespace Directories and File Names\n",
    "It is common to align the namespace with the directory and file structure. For example, a namespace `my-app.core` would usually be in a file located at `src/my_app/core.clj`."

    "## Main Function in Clojure\n",
    "\n",
    "In Clojure, there is no `main` function. Instead, you use the `-main` function. The `-main` function is just a convention, but it is a very common one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Clojure project, the main entry point is typically defined in a function named `-main`. This function serves as the starting point when you run a standalone Clojure application. The `-main` function often resides in the \"core\" namespace of the project, although you can place it in any namespace you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a `-main` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(ns my-app.core)\n",
    "\n",
    "(defn -main [&amp; args]\n",
    "  (println \"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "  (println \"Arguments passed:\" args))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Running the Program\n",
    "#### Using `lein run`\n",
    "If you are using Leiningen, you can specify the main namespace in your `project.clj` file like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defproject my-app \"0.1.0\"\n",
    "  :main my-app.core)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then you can run the program using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "lein run [args]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Using `clj`\n",
    "With the newer Clojure CLI tool, you can specify the main namespace and function when running your program. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "clj -M -m my-app.core [args]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Building a JAR\n",
    "You can also package your application into a standalone JAR file. When you specify the main namespace in the `project.clj` file, the `-main` function will be set as the entry point in the generated JAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate a standalone JAR using Leiningen, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "lein uberjar\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then run the generated JAR using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "java -jar target/my-app-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Receiving Command-line Arguments\n",
    "The `-main` function can receive command-line arguments in the form of a sequence, usually named `args` in the function's parameter list. Inside `-main`, you can then process these arguments as needed for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "The `-main` function acts as the main entry point in a Clojure application. How you run this function depends on the tools you are using, such as Leiningen or the Clojure CLI tool. This function is where your application starts execution, and it's where you typically place code for initializing your application and handling command-line arguments."

    "## Data Type Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "Clojure is a dynamically-typed language, which means that types are associated with values rather than variables. However, there are several ways to inspect the type of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `type`\n",
    "The `type` function returns the class of the object. This is the most straightforward way to check the type of a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(type 42)  ;=> java.lang.Long\n",
    "(type \"hello\")  ;=> java.lang.String\n",
    "(type {:a 1, :b 2})  ;=> clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Using `instance?`\n",
    "The `instance?` function checks if a value is an instance of a given class.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(instance? String \"hello\")  ;=> true\n",
    "(instance? java.util.List [1 2 3])  ;=> true\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Using `isa?`\n",
    "The `isa?` function checks for a relationship between types in a type hierarchy, but it's not commonly used for this purpose as it's more related to checking relationships between custom types or keywords in Clojure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using `cond` or `case`\n",
    "Sometimes, you may want to execute different code depending on the type of a value. For this, you can use `cond` or `case` combined with `type`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defn process-value [v]\n",
    "  (cond\n",
    "    (instance? String v) (str \"It's a string: \" v)\n",
    "    (instance? Number v) (str \"It's a number: \" v)\n",
    "    :else (str \"It's something else: \" v)))\n",
    "\n",
    "(process-value 42)  ;=> \"It's a number: 42\"\n",
    "(process-value \"hello\")  ;=> \"It's a string: hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Note on Idiomatic Clojure\n",
    "While it is possible to check the type of a value, idiomatic Clojure code usually relies more on protocols, multimethods, and functions that operate on abstractions rather than concrete types. The emphasis is often on \"what can this object do?\" rather than \"what is this object?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "However, type-checking might be useful in certain scenarios, such as data validation or interop with Java where type information is more crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Clojure provides multiple ways to check the type of a value, such as using `type`, `instance?`, or even conditional constructs like `cond`. However, idiomatic Clojure code often emphasizes behavior over explicit type-checking."

    "## User Input\n",
    "\n",
    "User input from the command line in Clojure is commonly handled using the `read-line` function for textual input, and the `*command-line-args*` variable for command line arguments. Here's a quick breakdown of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Textual Input with `read-line`\n",
    "The `read-line` function reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string. The function blocks until Enter (newline) is pressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defn ask-name []\n",
    "  (println \"What is your name?\")\n",
    "  (let [name (read-line)]\n",
    "    (println \"Hello,\" name)))\n",
    "\n",
    "(ask-name)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, when you run the function `ask-name`, it will print \"What is your name?\", then wait for you to type something. Whatever you type becomes the value of the `name` variable, and \"Hello, [Your Name]\" will be printed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Command Line Arguments with `*command-line-args*`\n",
    "Clojure provides the `*command-line-args*` dynamic variable, which contains any command line arguments passed to the script. This is particularly useful for scripts and standalone applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that reads command line arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defn main []\n",
    "  (println \"Command line arguments:\" *command-line-args*))\n",
    "\n",
    ";; Set the -main function for the application.\n",
    "(set! *main-cli-fn* main)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you run this script from the command line with arguments, it prints them out:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ clojure my_script.clj arg1 arg2 arg3\n",
    "Command line arguments: (arg1 arg2 arg3)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Combined Example\n",
    "You can combine both techniques in the same application to read command-line arguments and prompt the user for input:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defn main []\n",
    "  (println \"Command line arguments:\" *command-line-args*)\n",
    "  (println \"What is your name?\")\n",
    "  (let [name (read-line)]\n",
    "    (println \"Hello,\" name)))\n",
    "\n",
    "(set! *main-cli-fn* main)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "This program first prints out any command line arguments it receives, then asks the user for their name and greets them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries for Advanced Parsing\n",
    "For more advanced command-line parsing, you may want to use libraries like `clojure.tools.cli` that provide more functionality for defining and parsing command line options."

    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "In Clojure, lists are one of the fundamental data structures and are deeply integrated into the language's design. They are ordered collections that are similar to linked lists in other languages. Here is a thorough overview of what you can do with lists in Clojure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Lists\n",
    "You can create lists in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the list literal, which is simply a series of elements enclosed in parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(def my-list '(1 2 3))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```clojure\n",
    "(def my-list (list 1 2 3))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Reduce**: Reduce elements to a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(reduce + '(1 2 3))  ; => 6\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Reverse**: Reverse the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(reverse '(1 2 3))  ; => (3 2 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Lists\n",

    "(concat '(1 2) '(3 4))  ; => (1 2 3 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Append**: You can use `into` to append elements of one list to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(into '(1 2) '(3 4))  ; => (1 2 3 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Lists and Flattening\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flatten**: Flatten a nested list.```clojure\n",

    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(empty? '())  ; => true\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Contains**: Since lists are sequences, you can use `some` to check for the presence of an element.\n",

    "(set '(1 2 3))  ; => #{1 2 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Laziness\n",
    "Many sequence operations in Clojure are lazy, which means they are not computed until needed. This allows you to operate on large or even infinite lists efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(take 5 (cycle '(1 2 3)))  ; => (1 2 3 1 2)\n",

    "## Protocols in Clojure\n",
    "\n",
    "In Clojure, protocols are a mechanism for polymorphism and abstraction that allows you to define a set of functions that work on multiple types. Protocols are somewhat similar to interfaces in Java, but they are more dynamic and flexible. Protocols enable you to define a contract for methods without specifying how they should be implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Protocol\n",
    "You can define a protocol using the `defprotocol` macro. This defines one or more functions without any implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defprotocol Speak\n",
    "  \"Protocol for speaking entities\"\n",

    "  (speak [this]\n",
    "    (str \"The date is: \" (.toString this))))\n",

    "### Using a Protocol\n",
    "You can now call the `speak` function on any type that has been extended to implement the `Speak` protocol.\n",

    "```clojure\n",
    "(speak \"Hello\")\n",

    ";; => \"The date is: Sat Sep 18 00:00:00 PDT 2023\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Advantages of Protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Open to Extension**: One of the most compelling features of protocols is that you can extend existing Java classes or Clojure types with new behavior without altering their original definitions.\n",
    "- **Type-based Dispatch**: Unlike multimethods, which can dispatch based on arbitrary functions of their arguments, protocols dispatch solely based on the type of their first argument.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Protocols can be more performant than multimethods because the JVM can optimize method calls on known types.\n",
    "- **Easy Java Interop**: Protocols make it easier to interact with Java code by allowing you to extend Java interfaces or classes with Clojure functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Dispatch\n",
    "Protocols are dynamically dispatched based on the type of the first argument, so you can add new implementations for new types at runtime, and the correct method will be invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Record and Protocols\n",
    "When you define a record in Clojure, you can also specify that it implements one or more protocols, providing the methods inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defrecord Dog [name]\n",
    "  Speak\n",
    "  (speak [_]\n",

    "(def my-dog (->Dog \"Buddy\"))\n",
    "(speak my-dog)\n",
    ";; => \"Woof! I am Buddy\"\n",

    "```clojure\n",
    "(def counter (atom 0))\n",
    "\n",
    "(swap! counter inc) ; Atomically increments the value\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Refs\n",
    "Refs are used for situations where you need coordinated access to multiple states across multiple transactions. This mechanism works by employing Software Transactional Memory (STM). You can use `dosync`, `ref-set`, `alter` and `commute` to manage Refs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(def x (ref 0))\n",
    "(def y (ref 0))\n",
    "\n",
    "(dosync\n",
    "  (ref-set x 1)\n",
    "  (alter y + 3)) ; Inside a transaction\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Agents\n",
    "Agents are used for managing asynchronous state changes. State changes to agents will occur individually and will be processed in a queue. Agents are useful for tasks like write-behind logging or any other kind of asynchronous operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(def my-agent (agent 0))\n",
    "\n",
    "(send my-agent inc) ; Queues the inc function to run on my-agent\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Futures\n",
    "Futures are used for computations that will occur in another thread, and might be needed later. Futures are a good choice when you want to perform some computation in parallel and then retrieve the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(def my-future (future (* 2 2)))\n",
    "\n",
    "@my-future ; Dereferences the future to get the result, blocks if not ready\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Promises\n",
    "Promises are placeholders for a value that will be provided later. They are suitable for scenarios where you want to start some work in one part of your code and use the result in another place, regardless of which completes first.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(def my-promise (promise))\n",
    "\n",
    "(deliver my-promise \"hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "@my-promise ; => \"hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Channels (core.async)\n",
    "While not part of the Clojure core language, the core.async library provides CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes)-inspired concurrency primitives via channels. This model is highly expressive and useful for building complex asynchronous workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(require '[clojure.core.async :as async :refer [>! <! go chan]])\n",
    "\n",
    "(def c (chan))\n",
    "\n",
    "(go (>! c \"hello\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "(go (println (<! c))) ; prints \"hello\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each of these tools is useful for different scenarios, and often you might find yourself using a combination of them depending on what you need to do. The key to Clojure's approach to concurrency is to make it possible to write code that is free from locking and other synchronization mechanisms by encouraging immutability and providing higher-level abstractions to manage mutable state when needed."

    "## More Idioms in Clojure\n",
    "\n",
    "Some idiomatic Clojure practices that are useful to know:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Use Destructuring\n",
    "Clojure supports powerful destructuring, which allows you to bind names to values within collections easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(let [[x y] [1 2]\n",
    "      {:keys [a b]} {:a 3 :b 4}]\n",
    "  (println x y a b))  ; Output: 1 2 3 4\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 2. Prefer `->` and `->>` Macros for Transformation Pipelines\n",
    "The thread-first `->` and thread-last `->>` macros make code more readable when there are nested calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(-> 5\n",
    "    (+ 2)\n",
    "    (* 3)) ; => 21\n",
    "\n",
    "(->> [1 2 3]\n",
    "     (map inc)\n",
    "     (filter odd?)) ; => (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 3. Make Use of `some->` and `some->>` When Dealing with Nil\n",
    "These macros thread their argument only when it's not `nil`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(some-> {:a {:b 2}} :a :b inc)  ; => 3\n",
    "(some-> {:a nil} :a :b inc)     ; => nil\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 4. Use `cond->` for Conditional Threading\n",
    "The `cond->` macro allows for conditional threading, where each step is executed based on a predicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(cond-> [1 2 3]\n",
    "  true (conj 4)\n",
    "  false (conj 5)\n",
    "  true (conj 6)) ; => [1 2 3 4 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 5. Favor Pure Functions\n",
    "Idiomatic Clojure leans heavily towards functional programming. Whenever possible, make your functions pure, meaning they don't have side effects and produce the same output for the same input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Be Lazy\n",
    "Clojure encourages the use of lazy sequences for efficiency. Functions like `map`, `filter`, and many others return lazy sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Utilize Higher-Order Functions\n",
    "Higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `apply` are very idiomatic in Clojure and should be preferred over writing explicit loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Use Namespaces Wisely\n",
    "Divide your code into namespaces that group related functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(ns my-app.core)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 9. Use `defn-` for Private Functions\n",
    "If a function is only to be used within a particular namespace, make it private with `defn-`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(defn- private-fn [x]\n",
    "  (println \"I'm private\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 10. Prefer Sets for Membership Tests\n",
    "Use sets for efficient membership testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(def allowed-values #{1 2 3})\n",
    "(contains? allowed-values 2) ; => true\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 11. Prefer Keyword for Hash Map Lookups\n",
    "Keywords are functions that look themselves up when applied to a map, which makes for concise and readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(def my-map {:a 1 :b 2})\n",
    "(:a my-map) ; => 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 12. Use `partial`, `comp`, and `juxt` for Function Composition\n",
    "These functions allow you to create new functions from existing ones, making your code more modular and easier to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(map (comp inc #(* % 2)) [1 2 3]) ; => [3 5 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### 13. Leverage Dynamic Binding When Necessary\n",
    "Dynamic variables can be rebound within a `binding` block, providing thread-local state when absolutely needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "```clojure\n",
    "(def ^:dynamic *var* 1)\n",
    "(binding [*var* 2]\n",
    "  (println *var*)) ; => 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```"
