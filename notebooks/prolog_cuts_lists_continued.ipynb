    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a fundamental data structure in Prolog and are heavily used in many Prolog programs due to their versatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics of Lists in Prolog:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A list is either empty or consists of a head (the first element) and a tail (another list containing the remaining elements). The empty list is represented by `[]`.\n",
    "- **Constructing Lists**: Lists are constructed using the `|` operator. The head is on the left of the `|` and the tail (which is also a list) is on the right. For example, the list `[a, b, c]` can be thought of as `a | [b, c]`.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "   - `[]` – an empty list.\n",
    "   - `[a]` – a list with one element.\n",
    "   - `[a, b, c]` – a list with three elements.\n",
    "   - `[a | [b, c]]` – another way to represent the list with three elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations on Lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Head and Tail**: You can deconstruct a list into its head and tail:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "?- [Head | Tail] = [a, b, c].\n",
    "Head = a,\n",
    "Tail = [b, c].\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **Appending to Lists**: Prolog doesn't directly support appending an item to a list like some other languages. However, you can achieve this using the `append/3` predicate or by recursively constructing the list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "append([a, b], [c, d], Result).\n",
    "Result = [a, b, c, d].\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **List Membership**: To check if an item is a member of a list, you can use the `member/2` predicate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "?- member(b, [a, b, c]).\n",
    "true.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **List Length**: The `length/2` predicate can be used to determine the length of a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "?- length([a, b, c], Length).\n",
    "Length = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **List Concatenation**: The `append/3` predicate can also be used for concatenating two lists:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "?- append([a, b], [c, d], Result).\n",
    "Result = [a, b, c, d].\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recursive Operations:\n",
    "Many list operations in Prolog are implemented recursively, making use of the head and tail decomposition. For example, to sum all elements in a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog<button class=\"flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center\"><svg stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"icon-sm\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2\"></path><rect x=\"8\" y=\"2\" width=\"8\" height=\"4\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>\n",
    "sum_list([], 0).\n",
    "sum_list([Head | Tail], Total) :-\n",
    "    sum_list(Tail, SumTail),\n",
    "    Total is Head + SumTail.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Advanced Usage:\n",
    "Lists in Prolog can hold any term, including other lists, making them suitable for representing more complex structures like matrices, trees, etc. For example, the list `[[1,2], [3,4]]` represents a 2x2 matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations:\n",
    "It's worth noting that lists in Prolog, while powerful, are singly linked lists. Operations that append elements to the end or require accessing the end of a list are linear in time complexity. However, operations that work with the head of the list, like adding an element to the beginning or decomposing a list into its head and tail, are constant time operations.\n"

    "## List usage\n",
    "\n",
    "n Prolog, lists are a foundational data structure that's used in a wide variety of applications. Here are some typical usages:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Storage and Manipulation**:\n",
    "   - **Represent sequences**: e.g., a series of moves in a game, or a sequence of characters in a word.\n",
    "   - **Collect results**: Accumulate results in recursive predicates.\n",
    "   - **Transform lists**: Like converting numbers to their squares or strings to their uppercase counterparts.\n",
    "- **Graph Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - **Pathfinding**: Store visited nodes or the current path in a list.\n",
    "   - **Adjacency list representation**: Represent graphs where each node and its neighbors are stored as list items.\n",
    "- **Parsing and Tokenization**:\n",
    "   - **String processing**: Tokenize strings into lists of words or characters.\n",
    "   - **Building parsers**: Use lists to hold tokens or syntactic structures in context-free grammar parsers.\n",
    "- **Symbolic Computing**:\n",
    "   - **Arithmetic operations**: Implement custom arithmetic for large numbers, polynomials, etc., where numbers or terms are stored in lists.\n",
    "   - **Polynomial arithmetic**: Represent polynomials as lists of terms.\n",
    "- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**:\n",
    "   - **Decision Trees**: Use lists to represent paths or sequences of decisions.\n",
    "   - **Data representation**: Hold training data or feature vectors in lists.\n",
    "- **Functional Programming Constructs**:\n",
    "   - **Map, fold, and filter**: Common functional constructs can be implemented using lists in Prolog. For example, mapping a function over a list to transform its elements.\n",
    "- **Database Queries**:\n",
    "   - **Retrieve multiple results**: When querying a database in Prolog (where the \"database\" is typically a set of facts), you can accumulate multiple results in a list.\n",
    "- **Constraints and Combinatorial Problems**:\n",
    "   - **Sudoku solver**: Represent rows, columns, and grids using lists.\n",
    "   - **Permutations and combinations**: Generate and manipulate lists of possible combinations or permutations of items.\n",
    "- **Trees and Hierarchical Structures**:\n",
    "   - **Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)**: In compilers, represent program structure as a tree where each node can have a list of children.\n",
    "   - **General tree structures**: Represent trees where each node has a list of child nodes.\n",
    "- **Backtracking**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution space exploration**: Use lists to represent current candidates or partial solutions, and explore different paths via backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulation and Modeling**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulation states**: Use lists to represent states or sequences of events in simulations.\n",
    "- **Model entities**: E.g., representing people in a waiting line or items in an inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, lists in Prolog find utility in almost any scenario where there's a need for ordered collections, sequences, or sets of items. Given the declarative nature of Prolog and its inherent support for recursion, lists often provide an intuitive and efficient means to express solutions to a wide range of problems."

    "## Backtracking in Prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtracking is one of the fundamental concepts in Prolog and is at the heart of its declarative programming model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Backtracking?\n",
    "Backtracking is Prolog's mechanism for exploring different possible solutions to a problem. When Prolog attempts to satisfy a goal, it will try to match clauses from top to bottom. If a match is found, Prolog will proceed. If it later turns out that this choice cannot lead to a full solution, Prolog will \"backtrack\" to the last decision point and try a different path.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Backtracking Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choice Points**: Whenever Prolog encounters a predicate with multiple clauses (or a rule with multiple possible matches), it creates a \"choice point\". This means Prolog remembers that there's another option to come back to if the current choice doesn't pan out.\n",
    "- **Proceeding**: If the current choice leads to a successful solution, Prolog will return that solution. If there's more than one solution, Prolog will wait for the user to request additional solutions (typically by pressing the `;` key in the interactive environment).\n",
    "- **Backtracking**: If Prolog hits a dead-end (an unsatisfiable goal), it will backtrack to the most recent choice point and try a different option. If all options at the current choice point are exhausted, Prolog will backtrack further to a previous choice point.\n",
    "- **Failure**: If Prolog backtracks past the first goal (meaning all possible paths have been exhausted), the entire query fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "Consider the simple predicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "```prolog<button class=\"flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center\"><svg stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"icon-sm\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2\"></path><rect x=\"8\" y=\"2\" width=\"8\" height=\"4\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>\n",

    "likes(john, burger).\n",

    "```\n",
    "If we query `likes(john, What)`, Prolog first matches `pizza` for `What`. If you ask for another solution (by pressing `;`), Prolog backtracks to find the next match and returns `burger` for `What`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Backtracking Important?\n",
    "Backtracking allows Prolog to handle non-determinism, where multiple solutions or paths exist for a problem. This is especially useful for problems like search, constraint satisfaction, and combinatorial problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Precautions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Infinite Loops**: Carelessly defined rules can lead Prolog into infinite backtracking loops. It's essential to be mindful of the ordering of goals and clauses to prevent such scenarios.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Backtracking can be expensive, especially if the search space is vast. Optimizations, constraints, or heuristic rules might be needed for complex problems to limit the search space.\n",
    "- **Cut (`!`) Operator**: Prolog offers the \"cut\" operator, which is used to limit backtracking. When Prolog encounters a cut, it commits to all choices made since the last choice point, discarding other alternatives. This can be used to improve efficiency but must be used judiciously, as it can change the semantics of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, backtracking is what gives Prolog its powerful search capability and its ability to reason over sets of facts and rules to find solutions. However, with this power comes the responsibility to ensure efficient and correct program behavior."

    "## Cut operator\n",
    "\n",
    "The cut operator (`!`) in Prolog is a powerful tool that, when used, affects the normal flow of backtracking. It allows a programmer to commit to the choices made so far, effectively \"cutting off\" any alternative paths that Prolog might otherwise explore upon backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does the cut operator work?\n",
    "When Prolog encounters a cut during the execution of a goal, it commits to all choices made since the last choice point and discards all alternative choices. This means:\n",

    "- All choice points created after the parent goal of the cut and before the cut are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Usages of Cut\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Defining Deterministic Predicates**: If you know a predicate has only one solution and any further backtracking would be wasteful or erroneous, you can use a cut.\n",
    "- **Pruning Search Space**: In search problems, if you've found a satisfactory solution or know that backtracking would be unfruitful, you can use a cut to prevent it.\n",
    "- **Guarding Against Multiple Matches**: If you have a rule that should only apply in specific circumstances and shouldn't be reconsidered on backtracking, you can use a cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of Cut Usage\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate the effect of the cut:\n",

    "max(X, Y, Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The predicate `max/3` determines the maximum of two numbers. The cut ensures that once the first clause is true (i.e., `X` is greater than or equal to `Y`), the second clause will not be considered. So, if we query `max(5, 3, Max)`, Prolog won't try the second clause after finding `Max = 5` in the first clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the cut, if you asked for more solutions, Prolog would return `Max = 3` as well, which is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveats and Precautions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Semantics Change**: The use of a cut can change the semantics of a program. It's essential to ensure that the cut doesn't inadvertently eliminate valid solutions.\n",
    "- **Overuse**: Overusing the cut operator can make the logic of a Prolog program harder to follow and understand. It's a powerful tool, but it should be used judiciously.\n",
    "- **\"Green Cut\" vs. \"Red Cut\"**: In Prolog literature, you might come across these terms. A \"green cut\" is a cut that only affects the efficiency of a program, not its correctness. A \"red cut\" affects the program's semantics. Ideally, you should aim for green cuts to maintain clarity in the program's logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the cut operator is a tool to control the backtracking mechanism in Prolog. It can be beneficial for optimizing the execution of Prolog programs, but it should be used with care to avoid unintended consequences."

    "\n",
    "Let's dive into examples to differentiate between \"green cut\" and \"red cut\" in Prolog.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Green Cut\n",
    "A \"green cut\" is used primarily for optimization. It doesn't alter the correctness of the program but rather improves its efficiency by eliminating unnecessary backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",

    "    Result is N * TempResult.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code, the cut after `factorial(0, 1)` is a green cut. Without the cut, the factorial predicate would still give the correct answer, but with the cut, it prevents backtracking once we know for certain that `N` is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Red Cut\n",
    "A \"red cut\" affects the semantics of the program. It can change the overall behavior and possibly exclude valid solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "```prolog<button class=\"flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center\"><svg stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"icon-sm\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2\"></path><rect x=\"8\" y=\"2\" width=\"8\" height=\"4\" rx=\"1\" ry=\"1\"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>\n",
    "max(X, Y, X) :- X >= Y, !.\n",
    "max(X, Y, Y).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The cut in this `max/3` predicate is a red cut. Without the cut, if you queried `max(5, 5, Max)` and asked for multiple solutions, you'd get `Max = 5` twice, because both clauses would match. The cut ensures only one solution, but it also means that if the clauses were reordered, the program would give incorrect results for some inputs. The correctness of the predicate is now sensitive to the order of the clauses because of the cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while this particular red cut can be seen as beneficial (because it ensures a single correct answer), red cuts can be dangerous. If not used with caution, they can inadvertently prune valid solutions or produce incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it's recommended to use cuts, especially red cuts, judiciously and to be fully aware of their implications on the program's semantics."

    "\n",
    "List deconstruction (or decomposition) in Prolog refers to breaking down a list into its constituent elements, primarily its head (first element) and tail (remaining elements). This ability to deconstruct lists is foundational for many list-based operations in Prolog, given its lack of traditional loop structures like those found in imperative languages.\n",
    "\n",

    "In Prolog, a list can be represented as `[Head|Tail]`, where `Head` is the first element of the list and `Tail` is a list of the remaining elements.\n",

    "For example, for the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:\n",

    "\n",
    "- List deconstruction in Prolog is a fundamental concept and is utilized heavily due to Prolog's recursive nature.\n",

    "- **move/4**: This predicate performs a move for a player.\n",
    "   - It first checks if the move is valid (the position is empty) using the `empty/2` predicate.\n",
    "   - It then updates the board using the `replace/4` helper predicate to reflect the player's move.\n",
    "- **replace/4**: A helper predicate to replace an element in a list at a specific position.\n",
    "   - Used by `move/4` to place a player's mark (`x` or `o`) on the board.\n",
    "- **win/2**: This predicate checks if a player has won the game.\n",
    "   - It checks for a win condition in rows, columns, or diagonals using the helper predicates `row_win/2`, `col_win/2`, and `diagonal_win/2`.\n",
    "- **row_win/2**: Checks if there's a winning row for a player.\n",
    "   - It uses `member/2` to see if a row consisting entirely of the player's mark exists on the board.\n",
    "- **col_win/2**: Checks for a win in any column.\n",
    "   - It uses pattern matching to examine each column of the board.\n",
    "- **diagonal_win/2**: Checks for a win in the diagonals.\n",
    "   - Like `col_win/2`, it uses pattern matching to examine both diagonals of the board.\n",
    "- **draw/1**: Checks if the game is a draw.\n",
    "   - It checks if there's any `empty` cell left on the board using `member/2`. If not, and there's no win, it's a draw.\n",
    "- **display_board/1**: This predicate displays the current state of the board.\n",
    "   - The actual implementation was omitted in the previous code for brevity. It typically consists of printing each row.\n",
    "- **play/2**: This is the main game loop.\n",
    "   - It displays the board.\n",
    "   - It prompts the current player for a move.\n",
    "   - It performs the move, then checks for a win or a draw.\n",
    "   - If there's no win or draw, it switches to the other player and continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Game is Played:\n",
    "To play the game, you start with an empty board and the first player (e.g., `x`). The game loop (`play/2`) will then handle the rest: displaying the board, getting moves from players, checking for win/draw conditions, and switching between players.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game loop uses a recursive approach: after each move, it calls itself with the updated board and the next player, until a win or draw condition is met."

    "Structuring larger Prolog programs is essential for maintainability, clarity, and scalability. The Prolog language provides several features that support the modular development of programs. Here are some guidelines and best practices for structuring larger Prolog projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Modules**:\n",
    "   - Prolog's module system allows you to define predicates that are local to a module, helping prevent unintended interactions between predicates with the same name in different parts of the program.\n",
    "   - A module is defined using the `:- module/2` directive at the beginning of a file.\n",
    "   - You can import modules using the `:- use_module/1` directive.\n",
    "- **Decomposition**:\n",
    "   - Break down the program into smaller, logical components or units.\n",
    "   - Each component should have a clear responsibility. For example, in a knowledge-based system, you might have separate components for the knowledge base, the inference engine, the user interface, and utilities.\n",
    "- **Consistent Naming**:\n",
    "   - Adopt a naming convention and stick to it. Consistency in naming can make the code more readable and understandable.\n",
    "   - Predicate names should be descriptive. Use names that indicate what the predicate does.\n",
    "- **Documentation and Comments**:\n",
    "   - Document your code. Each module, predicate, and complex code block should have comments explaining their purpose and behavior.\n",
    "   - Use Prolog's documentation convention (using `/**\n",
    "   */`) to provide structured comments.\n",
    "- **Reuse and Abstraction**:\n",
    "   - Avoid repeating code. If you find yourself copying and pasting, consider creating a utility predicate that captures the repeated logic.\n",
    "   - Encapsulate complex operations within higher-level predicates.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Larger programs often involve more places where things can go wrong. Implement error checking and handling mechanisms.\n",
    "   - Use built-in predicates like `catch/3` and `throw/1` for exception handling.\n",
    "- **Testing**:\n",
    "   - Implement tests for your predicates. Use Prolog's unit testing framework (`plunit`) to write and run tests.\n",
    "   - Regular testing helps ensure that changes or additions to the codebase don't introduce new bugs.\n",
    "- **Data and Knowledge Separation**:\n",
    "   - Keep the data (like facts) separate from the rules.\n",
    "   - Consider using external databases or files for storing large sets of facts, and then loading them into the Prolog environment when needed.\n",
    "- **Optimization and Profiling**:\n",
    "   - For performance-critical applications, use Prolog's profiling tools to identify bottlenecks.\n",
    "   - Implement indexing, tail recursion, and other optimization techniques where necessary.\n",
    "- **Interaction with External Systems**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your Prolog system needs to interact with other software or systems, consider keeping interface code separate from core logic. This separation makes it easier to change or upgrade one part without affecting the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version Control**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- As with any software project, use version control systems (like Git) to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage releases."

    "## Debugging Prolog\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging Prolog programs can be a bit different from debugging programs written in more conventional imperative languages. Prolog's declarative nature, combined with backtracking, introduces unique challenges. Here are some strategies and tools for debugging Prolog:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tracer**:\n",
    "   - Most Prolog implementations come with a built-in tracer. By invoking the tracer, you can step through a query as it evaluates, watching it try different clauses and backtrack as necessary.\n",
    "   - Use the `trace/0` predicate to start the tracer and then call your query. For example, `trace, your_query_here.`.\n",
    "   - While in trace mode, you'll typically have options to step into (for deeper inspection) or step over (to skip details) predicates, among other actions.\n",
    "- **Print Statements**:\n",
    "   - Sometimes, the easiest way to see what's happening is to print out information at strategic points in your code.\n",
    "   - The predicates `write/1` and `writeln/1` can be used for this purpose. For example, you might add `write('Here'), nl.` in the middle of your code to see if a particular point is reached.\n",
    "- **Assert and Retract**:\n",
    "   - You can dynamically add and remove clauses from the knowledge base using `assert/1` and `retract/1`. This can be useful for adding temporary debug information or for simulating different conditions without altering the main code.\n",
    "- **Check Your Facts**:\n",
    "   - Simple errors in the database (e.g., typos in facts) can cause logic to fail. Always double-check your facts and clauses to ensure they are correctly stated.\n",
    "- **Failure**:\n",
    "   - Understand the point of failure. If a query is failing, add additional clauses that cater to the edge cases or conditions you might have missed.\n",
    "- **Explicitly Handle Backtracking**:\n",
    "   - If you suspect unnecessary backtracking is causing problems, you can use the cut operator (`!`) to limit it. However, use this with caution as it can also introduce bugs if not used correctly.\n",
    "- **Testing**:\n",
    "   - Implement tests for your predicates. The more tests you have, the more confident you can be in the correctness of your code.\n",
    "   - Prolog's unit testing framework (`plunit`) can be used to write and run tests.\n",
    "- **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Some Prolog environments provide visualization tools that can help you see the search tree or the sequence of choices the interpreter makes. This can be very useful for understanding the flow of more complex queries.\n",
    "- **Examine Variable Bindings**:\n",
    "   - One of the most common issues in Prolog programming is unexpected variable bindings. Check the bindings to ensure they match your expectations.\n",
    "- **Limit Depth**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you suspect infinite recursion, you can limit the recursion depth to prevent the program from running indefinitely. In SWI-Prolog, this can be done using `set_prolog_flag/2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **External Tools**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- SWI-Prolog offers tools like the GUI tracer, which is a more visual way to debug programs by allowing you to watch the execution, backtrack, inspect variables, and so on.\n"
