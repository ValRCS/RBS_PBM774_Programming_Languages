    "## Key concepts - history\n",
    "\n",
    "* Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data.\n",
    "* The concept of object-oriented programming had its roots in SIMULA 67, a programming language developed in the 1960s that introduced the idea of classes and objects.\n",
    "* Smalltalk, developed in the 1970s and 80s, is considered by many to be the base model for a purely object-oriented programming language.\n",
    "* Smalltalk 80, released in 1980, is a popular implementation of the Smalltalk language and is often cited as a landmark in the history of object-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key requirements for object-oriented programming\n",
    "\n",
    "A language that is object-oriented must provide support for three key language features:\n",
    "1. Abstract data types: A way to define a new data type that encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data.\n",
    "2. Inheritance: A way to define a new class that is based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods.\n",
    "3. Dynamic binding of method calls to methods: A way for the code to decide which implementation of a method to use based on the type of the object at runtime."

    "## Reflection in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "* In Python, reflection is used to examine and modify the types and structure of a program at runtime. Python provides several built-in functions and modules that enable developers to perform introspection on objects, classes, and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For example, the built-in function type() can be used to determine the type of an object or class. The inspect module provides functions for retrieving information about functions, classes, and modules, including their names, arguments, and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python also supports dynamic attribute access and modification through the use of the getattr() and setattr() functions. These functions allow developers to get and set attributes of an object or class by name at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reflection is commonly used in Python for debugging, testing, and dynamic configuration. For example, the unittest module uses reflection to automatically discover and run tests in a Python project. The logging module uses reflection to dynamically configure logging behavior based on user-defined settings."
