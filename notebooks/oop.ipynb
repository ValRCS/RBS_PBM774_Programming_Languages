        "* Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code to manipulate that data.\n",
        "* The concept of object-oriented programming had its roots in SIMULA I, SIMULA 67, a programming language developed in the 1960s that introduced the idea of classes and objects.\n",
        "* Smalltalk, developed in the 1970s and 80s, is considered by many to be the base model for a purely object-oriented programming language.\n",
        "Smalltalk was developed by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, Ted Kaehler, and others at Xerox PARC.\n",
        "* Smalltalk 80, released in 1980, is a popular implementation of the Smalltalk language and is often cited as a landmark in the history of object-oriented programming.\n",

        "### Key requirements for object-oriented programming\n",
        "\n",
        "A language that is object-oriented must provide support for three key language features:\n",
        "1. Abstract data types: A way to define a new data type that encapsulates data and functions that operate on that data.\n",
        "2. Inheritance: A way to define a new class that is based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods.\n",
        "3. Dynamic binding of method calls to methods: A way for the code to decide which implementation of a method to use based on the type of the object at runtime."

For example, the unittest module uses reflection to automatically discover and run tests in a Python project.
