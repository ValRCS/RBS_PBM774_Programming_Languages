        "Expressions and assignment statements are essential components in programming languages, as they allow you to manipulate and store values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators that produce a new value. For example, you can use an expression to perform arithmetic operations, such as adding two numbers or multiplying them. In many programming languages, expressions can also include function calls or comparisons between values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Assignment statements, on the other hand, allow you to store the result of an expression in a variable. For example, you can use an assignment statement to assign the result of an arithmetic operation to a variable, which you can then use later in your program. Assignment statements typically use the equal sign (=) to indicate that you're storing a value in a variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, expressions and assignment statements provide the basic building blocks for performing computations and storing results in a program. They are used in virtually every type of program, from simple scripts to complex applications."
