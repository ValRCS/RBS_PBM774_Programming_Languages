    "### Ishango Bone (20,000 BC)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/46/Ishango-color-2views.png\" alt=\"Bone\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ishango Bone is one of the oldest known artifacts related to mathematics and possibly early computational thinking. It's an artifact that dates back to the Upper Paleolithic era, estimated to be around 20,000 years old. The bone was found in 1960 by Belgian geologist Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt while exploring the Ishango region near the Semliki River, in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bone itself is a tool made from the fibula of a large animal most likely a baboon, and it's marked with a series of notches carved into three columns. These notches are thought to represent a rudimentary form of counting or possibly even more advanced arithmetic operations. The exact purpose and the methods used to create the notches are subjects of scholarly debate, but some interpretations suggest that the artifact might have been used for simple arithmetic tasks like addition and subtraction, or possibly for more complex tasks such as multiplication and division.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretations of the Notches:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Counting**: The simplest interpretation is that the notches were used for counting. The grouping of notches could have been a way to keep track of quantities.\n",
    "- **Arithmetic Sequences**: Some researchers propose that the notches represent arithmetic sequences. For instance, one column appears to be a counting sequence doubled:\n",
    "10\n",
    ",\n",
    "20\n",
    ",\n",
    "30\n",
    ",\n",
    "…\n",
    "10, 20, 30, \\ldots\n",
    "10,\n",
    "20,\n",
    "30,\n",
    "….\n",
    "- **Prime Numbers**: Another column seems to represent the numbers 11, 13, 17, and 19, which are prime numbers. However, the interpretation of these notches as prime numbers is speculative and not universally accepted.\n",
    "- **Lunar Calendar**: Some scholars have suggested that the Ishango Bone may have been used as a lunar calendar. The bone's markings could relate to the roughly 29.5-day lunar cycle.\n",
    "- **Multiple Uses**: It's also possible that the bone was used for multiple purposes, serving both as a tool for arithmetic and as a calendar or other form of record-keeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Significance:\n",
    "The Ishango Bone is significant because it provides evidence of early numerical awareness and the capability for abstract thought among prehistoric peoples. While it's not a \"computer\" or \"programming language\" in the way we understand those terms today, the bone could represent a step on the long path of human computational development. It shows that even in prehistoric times, humans were thinking in ways that could be considered precursors to more formalized mathematical and computational systems.\n",

    "### Algorithms and Formal Logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans have been using algorithms and formal logic for thousands of years. Here are some notable examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Euclidean Algorithm\n",
    "One of the earliest and most famous algorithms is the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This algorithm appears in Euclid's \"Elements,\" which dates back to around 300 BCE.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms works as follows:\n",
    "* Given two numbers, a and b, find the remainder r when a is divided by b.\n",
    "* If r is zero, then b is the GCD of a and b.\n",
    "* If r is not zero, set a to b, b to r, and repeat steps 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is an example of pseudocode for the Euclidean algorithm. Pseudocode is a way to express algorithms in a language-agnostic way. It's similar to code, but it's not tied to any particular programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img alt=\"gcd\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Euclidean_algorithm_1071_462.gif/340px-Euclidean_algorithm_1071_462.gif\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Babylonian Square Root Algorithm\n",
    "The Babylonians had an algorithm for approximating the square root of a number, which dates back to around 1800 BCE. The method uses a form of successive approximation that is surprisingly similar to methods used in numerical computing today.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chinese Remainder Theorem\n",
    "While not an algorithm in the modern sense, the Chinese Remainder Theorem has algorithmic applications in computing, modular arithmetic, algebra, and cryptography. The theorem is described in a Chinese book called \"Sunzi Suanjing,\" which may have been written as early as the 3rd century AD.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sieve of Eratosthenes\n",
    "Named after the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, this algorithm is used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. It was described in the 3rd century BCE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithms in Persian and Islamic Mathematics\n",
    "During the Islamic Golden Age (8th to 14th centuries), scholars like Al-Khwarizmi contributed significantly to the development of algorithms, particularly in algebra. In fact, the word \"algorithm\" is derived from his name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fibonacci Sequence\n",
    "Leonardo of Pisa, commonly known as Fibonacci, introduced a sequence of numbers in his book \"Liber Abaci,\" published in 1202, that are now known as the Fibonacci numbers. He described the sequence in the context of a problem related to rabbit population growth, but the sequence itself serves as the basis for algorithms in computer science, mathematics, and even in stock market analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Newton-Raphson Method\n",
    "In the 17th century, Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson independently described an iterative method to find successively better approximations to the roots (or zeros) of a real-valued function. This algorithm is used widely in numerical methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gaussian Elimination\n",
    "Although named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, who systematically described the method in the 19th century, variations of this algorithm for solving systems of linear equations date back to ancient China.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Early Sorting and Searching Algorithms\n",
    "While not formally described as algorithms, various methods of sorting and searching have been used throughout human history, from basic techniques like bubble sort to more complicated methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "These early algorithms provided a foundation for the study of algorithmic procedures and laid the groundwork for the development of modern algorithms and data structures used in computer science today.\n",

    "### Jacquard Loom (1801)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jacquard loom, invented by Joseph Marie Jacquard in early 19th-century France, represents a significant milestone in both the textile industry and the history of computing. The loom used a series of punched cards to control the weaving process, allowing for the automated creation of complex patterns in fabric. This was a significant improvement over previous looms, which required manual labor to produce intricate designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "![loom](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Deutsches_Technikmuseum_Berlin_February_2008_0013.JPG/240px-Deutsches_Technikmuseum_Berlin_February_2008_0013.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "The Jacquard loom employed a chain of punched cards laced together. Each card corresponded to a row of the design. Holes or the absence thereof in the card determined whether a series of threads would be raised or not. When a hole was encountered, a hook would go through and lift the thread, allowing the shuttle to pass beneath it. This mechanism facilitated the weaving of intricate patterns, even portraits and landscapes, automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Influence on Computing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Punched Cards**: The concept of using punched cards to control a machine was adopted in computing. Herman Hollerith, for example, used punched cards in the tabulating machine he designed for the U.S. Census, leading to the formation of IBM.\n",
    "- **Conditional Branching**: The Jacquard loom could change patterns by changing the sequence of punched cards. This was a primitive form of conditional branching—a fundamental concept in programming.\n",
    "- **Programmability**: The loom was \"programmable\" in the sense that it executed operations based on instructions from punched cards, a feature that has been integral to the development of modern computers.\n",
    "- **Data and Instruction**: The separation between the machine (the loom) and the program (the punched cards) marked one of the earliest instances of a clear distinction between hardware and software, or data and instruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Impact on Textile Industry:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automation and Labor**: The loom significantly reduced the amount of manual labor required to produce complex textiles, thus increasing efficiency but also causing labor displacement.\n",
    "- **Quality and Complexity**: It raised the quality and complexity of fabric that could be produced, leading to new designs and patterns that were not feasible manually.\n",
    "- **Mass Production**: The technology made it easier to reproduce particular patterns, paving the way for mass production in the textile industry.\n",
    "- **Customization**: By simply changing the punched cards, manufacturers could easily switch from one design to another, allowing for greater customization than before.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jacquard loom was not only revolutionary for the textile industry but also served as an inspiration for later computational machines. Ada Lovelace, often credited with writing the first computer program, noted the similarities between the Jacquard loom’s punched cards and Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, highlighting the loom’s influence on early concepts of programmability and computational logic.\n",

    "![Ada](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg/440px-Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ada Lovelace, born Augusta Ada Byron in 1815, was an English mathematician and writer primarily known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the daughter of the renowned poet Lord Byron and Anne Isabella Milbanke. Despite her poetic lineage, her educational focus was on mathematics and logic, a path encouraged by her mother.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Collaboration with Charles Babbage\n",
    "Ada Lovelace met Charles Babbage in 1833, when she was just 17 years old. Fascinated by Babbage's ideas, particularly his design for the Analytical Engine, she began a correspondence with him that lasted many years. Babbage had earlier invented the Difference Engine, a simpler calculating device, but his vision for the Analytical Engine was far more ambitious. It was intended to be programmable via punched cards, similar to the Jacquard loom.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes on the Analytical Engine\n",
    "Lovelace's most enduring contribution to computer science came in the form of notes she appended to the translation of an article by Italian mathematician Luigi Federico Menabrea about the Analytical Engine. Her notes were three times longer than the original article and included several major insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithm for the Analytical Engine**: Lovelace provided what is considered to be the first algorithm intended for processing by a computer—a method for the Analytical Engine to calculate Bernoulli numbers. This has led many to consider her the world's first computer programmer.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Bernoulli](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/Diagram_for_the_computation_of_Bernoulli_numbers.jpg/440px-Diagram_for_the_computation_of_Bernoulli_numbers.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concept of General Computing**: While Babbage was primarily interested in the machine's applications for mathematical calculations, Lovelace foresaw broader possibilities. She speculated that the engine might one day manipulate symbols and even create music or art, given the right inputs and programming. This vision of a machine that could manipulate symbols in a way applicable to any field, not just mathematics, is remarkably similar to the concept of a modern computer.\n",
    "- **Looping and Iteration**: Though less emphasized, her notes also include discussions about how the engine could use looping to perform some tasks, a concept central to modern computing.\n",
    "- **Critique and Error Checking**: Lovelace also offered critiques of the design and suggestions for improvements, including the idea of error checking. She didn't just translate and elaborate upon Menabrea's work but also added substantial original thought.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Legacy\n",
    "Though the Analytical Engine was never built due to financial and engineering constraints, Lovelace's notes have been deeply influential:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inspirational Figure**: As one of the first women involved in computing, and certainly the first to articulate its potential in such broad terms, Lovelace has become an inspirational figure in both computing and the broader fight for gender equality in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).\n",
    "- **Ada Programming Language**: The Ada programming language, developed in the late 20th century for the U.S. Department of Defense, was named in her honor.\n",
    "- **Ada Lovelace Day**: Celebrated in mid-October, this day aims to increase the profile of women in STEM and to create new role models for girls studying these subjects.\n",

    "### Alan Turing (1912-1954) and Turing Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Alan Turing, a British mathematician and logician, is often considered one of the founding figures of computer science and artificial intelligence. He is perhaps best known for his concept of the Turing machine, a theoretical construct that he introduced in 1936. Turing's work was seminal in both the theory of computation and the practical development of computers, making him a key figure in the history of programming as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Turing Machine\n",
    "A Turing machine is a mathematical model of computation that defines an abstract machine, capable of manipulating symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. Despite its simplicity, a Turing machine can simulate the logic of any computer algorithm, given enough time and resources. The machine uses a 'head' that can move left or right across a tape, reading or writing symbols as it goes, and its behavior is controlled by a finite set of rules that dictate what it should do based on the current symbol under the head.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Machine](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Turing_machine_1.JPG/600px-Turing_machine_1.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Significance for Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Universality**: One of Turing's most important contributions was the concept of a Universal Turing Machine—a Turing machine capable of simulating any other Turing machine given its table of rules encoded as input. This concept is the foundation for the idea that a general-purpose computer can run any computable program, making it universal.\n",
    "- **Decidability and Computability**: Turing machines provided a precise way to talk about algorithms and what can be computed. Turing's work also led to the identification of problems that are computationally \"undecidable,\" meaning no algorithm can solve them in all cases.\n",
    "- **High-Level Languages**: Turing's abstract machine provided a foundation for understanding what a higher-level programming language is and what it should be capable of. Because any Turing-complete language can theoretically simulate a Turing machine, it can carry out any computation that the machine can, given enough time and resources.\n",
    "- **Algorithmic Thinking**: The Turing machine model helps in formalizing the notion of an algorithm, allowing people to reason more effectively about program behavior and complexity.\n",
    "- **Basis for Real-world Computing**: Turing's work directly and indirectly influenced the development of early computers like the ENIAC, Manchester Mark 1, and the EDSAC. His work at Bletchley Park during WWII on breaking the Enigma code also involved practical programming of a sort, for specialized cryptographic hardware.\n",
    "- **Impact on Artificial Intelligence**: Turing's 1950 paper, \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" set the stage for the field of artificial intelligence. He introduced the \"Turing Test\" as a measure of machine intelligence, a concept still discussed and debated today.\n",
    "- **Software Before Hardware**: Turing's theoretical work laid the groundwork for understanding that software—algorithms and programs—could be as important as hardware in computing systems. This balance between software and hardware remains a key concept in computer science and programming.\n"

    "Alonzo Church, an American mathematician and logician, is another pivotal figure in the history of computer science and theoretical computation. He is best known for his development of lambda calculus, a formal system for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. Lambda calculus served as a foundation for functional programming languages and also played a critical role in the formalization of computation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Church-Turing Thesis is a hypothesis about the nature of computable functions. It posits that a function is computable if and only if it can be calculated by a Turing machine. Independently but almost simultaneously, both Church and Turing came up with models for what constitutes a computable function—Church with his lambda calculus and Turing with his Turing machine. The Church-Turing Thesis suggests that these two very different-looking formalisms are actually equivalent in computing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unified Framework**: The Church-Turing Thesis provided a unified framework for thinking about what problems can and cannot be solved algorithmically, unifying a range of models of computation.\n",
    "- **Decidability**: Both Church and Turing focused on the concept of decidability: whether a given problem can be solved by algorithmic means. Their work laid the groundwork for understanding limitations in computing.\n",
    "- **Foundations for Programming**: Lambda calculus has been influential in the development of functional programming languages like Lisp, Haskell, and Scheme, providing fundamental concepts like first-class functions, higher-order functions, and recursion.\n",
    "- **Informal Proofs**: The Church-Turing Thesis has been used to justify the informal notion that if an algorithm exists for doing something, then it can be done by a Turing machine (and vice versa). This is often used as the foundation for reasoning about the complexity and capability of algorithms.\n",
    "- **Computational Complexity**: The equivalence between different forms of computation as formalized by the Church-Turing Thesis is foundational to the field of computational complexity theory, which studies the resources (like time and space) required for solving computational problems.\n",
    "- **Functional Programming**: The influence of lambda calculus is seen in the paradigms and idioms of functional programming, a style of programming that has important applications in concurrent and distributed systems, formal verification, and other fields.\n",
    "- **Philosophical Implications**: The Church-Turing Thesis also has implications in the philosophy of mind, particularly in discussions about the extent to which human cognition can be understood as computation.\n",

    "Konrad Zuse, a German engineer, developed the programming language Plankalkül between 1942 and 1945, although it was not published or implemented until years later. Plankalkül is significant because it's often cited as the world's first high-level programming language, predating other efforts to create a high-level language for computers. Unfortunately, due to the timing (World War II), his work was not widely known until much later, and it had limited immediate influence on the development of computing.\n",

    "### Data Structures in Plankalkül\n",
    "Plankalkül was quite advanced for its time and included several data structures and types, as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple Data Types**: It provided for floating-point and integer types.\n",
    "- **Arrays**: Plankalkül included support for multi-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- **Records**: It had a notion similar to records (akin to structs in C or objects in some other languages), where multiple data fields could be grouped together.\n",
    "- **Boolean Algebra**: The language also supported Boolean logic, providing the ability to create complex conditional statements.\n",
    "- **Pseudocode and Notation**: Plankalkül was designed with a sort of pseudocode and formal notation, which laid the groundwork for describing algorithms in a way that could be systematically translated into machine operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The language also aimed to support complex operations like loops, conditionals, and even some form of error checking. Its conceptual model of a program was quite similar to modern understandings, with clear distinctions between the program and data, and provisions for modifiable storage (what we'd now call variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact and Legacy\n",
    "Plankalkül was not implemented during Zuse's time due to various factors, including the war and the absence of sufficiently powerful hardware. However, it was eventually implemented and tested in the 1970s and 1990s, confirming that it could indeed function as a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though Plankalkül did not influence early programming languages like Fortran or Lisp because it was not widely known, its later discovery showed that many of the ideas crucial to the development of high-level languages were already present in Zuse's work.

    "### Programming at raw hardware 1940s-1950s\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming in the era before 1950 was a laborious and highly specialized task that bore little resemblance to modern software development. At this early stage in the history of computing, \"programming\" often meant physically manipulating the machine's hardware rather than writing code as we understand it today. Here are some key aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine-Specific Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plugboards and Wiring**: Many early computers, like the ENIAC, used plugboards and wiring to set up calculations. This meant that \"programming\" was often a matter of physically reconfiguring the machine.\n",
    "- **Punched Cards**: For some machines, programming involved the use of punched cards that were fed into the machine to control its operations. This method was often used in business machines like those produced by IBM before the advent of electronic computers.\n",
    "- **Switches and Dials**: Early computers like the Manchester Mark 1 had banks of switches and dials that could be used to input binary data directly into the machine's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Low-Level Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Machine Language**: Programs were written in raw machine language, tailored to the specific architecture of the machine. This required a deep understanding of the machine's internal workings.\n",
    "- **No Abstractions**: There were no high-level languages, libraries, or operating systems to simplify tasks. Every program was built from scratch, often requiring the programmer to manage every aspect of the computation.\n",
    "- **Limited Resources**: Memory and processing power were extremely limited, which meant programs had to be highly optimized.\n",

    "#### Specialized Skills and Labor\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Human \"Computers\"**: Prior to electronic machines, the term \"computer\" often referred to people—usually women—who performed calculations manually. Transitioning from human computers to machine computing required a new skill set.\n",
    "- **Interdisciplinary Teams**: Programming was not yet a distinct profession but was often done by interdisciplinary teams that included mathematicians, engineers, and physicists.\n",
    "- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting was often a physical task that involved checking machine components for faults—a far cry from today's debugging practices.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **ENIAC**: The Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was one of the earliest electronic general-purpose computers, used primarily for artillery trajectory calculations.\n",
    "- **EDSAC and Stored Programs**: The EDSAC (Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator) at the University of Cambridge was one of the first computers to implement the concept of stored programs, making it easier to reprogram.\n",
    "- **Colossus**: Used by British codebreakers during World War II, this machine was designed for a specific task: decrypting German ciphers.\n",
    "- **Alan Turing and the Bombe**: Though not a general-purpose computer, Turing's Bombe was a specialized machine used to help decipher the German Enigma code.\n",
    "- **UNIVAC**: The Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC) was among the first commercial computers and used a higher-level assembly language, paving the way for more modern programming practices.\n",
    "- **IBM Machines**: Before transitioning to electronic computers, IBM produced electromechanical machines programmed primarily via punched cards.\n",

    "#### Bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"bug\" is often attributed to Grace Hopper, who was a pioneer in the field of computer programming. In 1947, she was working on the Harvard Mark II computer when she found a moth stuck in one of the relays. She taped the moth to the logbook and wrote, \"First actual case of bug being found.\" The term \"debugging\" was used to describe the process of fixing problems in the machine.\n",
